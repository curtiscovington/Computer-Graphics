# Computer Graphics HW1 - Curtis Covington

`bin/hw1.exe` is the make output

Entry point `src/hw1.cpp`

Shaders are in the shaders folder.

*The obj folder needs the empty engine folder, I have not been able to figure out how to make my make file auto generate it.*

`make` will compile the executable into the bin folder

`make run` should compile and run the program


# Controls

Space = Toggle Perspective and Orthographic

Arrow Keys or WASD = Camera Movement

QE                 = Move Camera In/Move Camera Out

IJKL               = Camera Rotation

Escape             = Close Program

# Approximate Time

5ish hours. Most fixing my project structure. Then playing with the shader.
