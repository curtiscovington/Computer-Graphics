# Computer Graphics HW2 - Curtis Covington

`bin/hw2.exe` is the make output

Entry point `src/main.cpp`

Shaders are in the shaders folder.

*The obj folder needs the empty engine folder, I have not been able to figure out how to make my make file auto generate it.*

`make` will compile the executable into the bin folder

`make run` should compile and run the program

`make clean` will clean the project structure


# Controls

Space = Toggle Perspective and Orthographic

Arrow Keys or WASD = Movement

Right Click and Mouse Move = Camera Movement

Escape             = Close Program

# Approximate Time

6 hours. Updating project structure, allowing for camera movement by mouse, and playing with the shader.
